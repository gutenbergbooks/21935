    <h2>
      TO CHILDREN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Author of this book is also the Editor of the Blue, Red, Greenland
      Yellow Fairy Books. He has always felt rather an impostor, because so many
      children seem to think that he made up these books out of his own head.
      Now he only picked up a great many old fairy tales, told in French,
      German, Greek, Chinese, Red Indian, Russian, and other languages, and had
      them translated and printed, with pictures. He is glad that children like
      them, but he must confess that they should be grateful to old forgotten
      people, long ago, who first invented these tales, and who knew more about
      fairies than we can hope to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>My Own Fairy Book</i>, which you now have in your hands, was made up
      altogether out of his own head by the Author, of course with the help of
      the Historical Papers in the kingdom of Pantouflia. About that ancient
      kingdom very little is known. The natives speak German; but the Royal
      Family, as usual, was of foreign origin. Just as England has had Norman,
      Scottish, and, at present, a line of German monarchs, so the kings of
      Pantouflia are descended from an old Greek family, the Hypnotidæ, who came
      to Pantouflia during the Crusades. They wanted, they explained, not to be
      troubled with the Crusades, which they thought very injudicious and
      tiresome. The Crest of the regal house is a Dormouse, dormant, proper, on
      a field vert, and the Motto, when translated out of the original Greek,
      means, <i>Anything for a Quiet Life</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may surprise the young reader that princes like Prigio and Ricardo,
      whose feet were ever in the stirrup, and whose lances were always in rest,
      should have descended from the family of the Hypnotidæ, who were
      remarkably lazy and peaceful. But these heroes doubtless inherited the
      spirit of their great ancestress, whose story is necessary to be known. On
      leaving his native realm during the Crusades, in search of some secure
      asylum, the founder of the Pantouflian monarchy landed in the island of
      Cyprus, where, during the noon-tide heat, he lay down to sleep in a cave.
      Now in this cave dwelt a dragon of enormous size and unamiable character.
      What was the horror of the exiled prince when he was aroused from slumber
      by the fiery breath of the dragon, and felt its scaly coils about him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang your practical jokes!&rdquo; exclaimed the prince, imagining that some
      of his courtiers were playing a prank on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call <i>this</i> a joke?&rdquo; asked the dragon, twisting its forked
      tail into a line with his royal highness&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do take that thing away,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;and let a man have his nap
      peacefully.&lsquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me!&rdquo; cried the dragon, which had already devoured many gallant
      knights for declining to kiss it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give you a kiss,&rdquo; murmured the prince; &ldquo;oh, certainly, if that&rsquo;s all! <i>Anything
      for a quiet life.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he kissed the dragon, which instantly became a most beautiful
      princess; for she had lain enchanted as a dragon, by a wicked magician,
      till somebody should be bold enough to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love! my hero! my lord! how long I have waited for thee; and now I am
      eternally thine own!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So murmured, in the most affectionate accents, the Lady Dragonissa, as she
      was now called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though wedded to a bachelor life, the prince was much too well-bred to
      make any remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Dragonissa, a female of extraordinary spirit, energy, and
      ambition, took command of him and of his followers, conducted them up the
      Danube, seized a principality whose lord had gone crusading, set her
      husband on the throne, and became in course of time the mother of a little
      prince, who, again, was great, great, great, great-grandfather of our
      Prince Prigio.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this adventurous Lady Dragonissa, Prince Prigio derived his character
      for gallantry. But her husband, it is said, was often heard to remark, by
      a slight change of his family motto:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Anything for a Quiet Wife!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You now know as much as the Author does of the early history of
      Pantouflia.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the story called <i>The Gold of Fairnilee</i>, such adventures were
      extremely common in Scotland long ago, as may be read in many of the works
      of Sir Walter Scott and of the learned in general. Indeed, Fairnilee is
      the very place where the fairy queen appointed to meet her lover, Thomas
      the Rhymer.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these explanations, the Author leaves to the judgment of young
      readers his <i>Own Fairy Book</i>.

      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In compiling the following History from the Archives of Pantouflia, the
      Editor has incurred several obligations to the Learned. The Return of
      Benson (chapter xii.) is the fruit of the research of the late Mr. Allen
      Quatermain, while the final <i>wish</i> of Prince Prigio was suggested by
      the invention or erudition of a Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      A study of the <i>Firedrake</i> in South Africa, where he is called the <i>Nanaboulélé</i>,
      a difficult word-has been published in French (translated from the Basuto
      language) by M. Paul Sébillot, in the <i>Revue des Traditione Populaires</i>.
      For the <i>Rémora</i>, the Editor is indebted to the <i>Voyage à la Lune</i>
      of M. Cyrano de Bergérac.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;<i>How the Fairies were not Invited to Court</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      ONCE upon a time there reigned in Pantouflia a king and a queen. With
      almost everything else to make them happy, they wanted one thing: they had
      no children. This vexed the king even more than the queen, who was very
      clever and learned, and who had hated dolls when she was a child. However,
      she too, in spite of all the books she read and all the pictures she
      painted, would have been glad enough to be the mother of a little prince.
      The king was anxious to consult the fairies, but the queen would not hear
      of such a thing. She did not believe in fairies: she said that they had
      never existed; and that she maintained, though <i>The History of the Royal
      Family</i> was full of chapters about nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, at long and at last they had a little boy, who was generally
      regarded as the finest baby that had ever been seen. Even her majesty
      herself remarked that, though she could never believe all the courtiers
      told her, yet he certainly was a fine child&mdash;a very fine child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the time drew near for the christening party, and the king and queen
      were sitting at breakfast in their summer parlour talking over it. It was
      a splendid room, hung with portraits of the royal ancestors. There was
      Cinderella, the grandmother of the reigning monarch, with her little foot
      in her glass slipper thrust out before her. There was the Marquis de
      Carabas, who, as everyone knows, was raised to the throne as prince
      consort after his marriage with the daughter of the king of the period. On
      the arm of the throne was seated his celebrated cat, wearing boots. There,
      too, was a portrait of a beautiful lady, sound asleep: this was Madame La
      Belle au Bois-dormant, also an ancestress of the royal family. Many other
      pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have asked all the right people, my dear?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone who should be asked,&rdquo; answered the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People are so touchy on these occasions,&rdquo; said his majesty. &ldquo;You have not
      forgotten any of our aunts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the old cats!&rdquo; replied the queen; for the king&rsquo;s aunts were
      old-fashioned, and did not approve of her, and she knew it. &ldquo;They are very
      kind old ladies in their way,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;and were nice to me when I
      was a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he waited a little, and remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fairies, of course, you have invited? It has always been usual, in
      our family, on an occasion like this; and I think we have neglected them a
      little of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How <i>can</i> you be so <i>absurd?</i>&rdquo; cried the queen. &ldquo;How often must
      I tell you that there are <i>no</i> fairies? And even if there were&mdash;but,
      no matter; pray let us drop the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very old friends of our family, my dear, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the
      king timidly. &ldquo;Often and often they have been godmothers to us. One, in
      particular, was most kind and most serviceable to Cinderella I., my own
      grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandmother!&rdquo; interrupted her majesty. &ldquo;Fiddle-de-dee! If anyone
      puts such nonsense into the head of my little Prigio&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here the baby was brought in by the nurse, and the queen almost
      devoured it with kisses. And so the fairies were not invited! It was an
      extraordinary thing, but none of the nobles could come to the christening
      party when they learned that the fairies had not been asked. Some were
      abroad; several were ill; a few were in prison among the Saracens; others
      were captives in the dens of ogres. The end of it was that the king and
      queen had to sit down alone, one at each end of a very long table, arrayed
      with plates and glasses for a hundred guests&mdash;for a hundred guests
      who never came!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any soup, my dear?&rdquo; shouted the king, through a speaking-trumpet; when,
      suddenly, the air was filled with a sound like the rustling of the wings
      of birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flitter, flitter, flutter</i>, went the noise; and when the queen
      looked up, lo and behold! on every seat was a lovely fairy, dressed in
      green, each with a <i>most interesting-looking parcel</i> in her hand.
      Don&rsquo;t you like opening parcels? The king did, and he was most friendly and
      polite to the fairies. But the queen, though she saw them distinctly, took
      no notice of them. You see, she did not believe in fairies, nor in her own
      eyes, when she saw them. So she talked across the fairies to the king,
      just as if they had not been there; but the king behaved as politely as if
      they were <i>real</i>&mdash;which, of course, they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was over, and when the nurse had brought in the baby, all the
      fairies gave him the most magnificent presents. One offered a purse which
      could never be empty; and one a pair of seven-leagued boots; and another a
      cap of darkness, that nobody might see the prince when he put it on; and
      another a wishing-cap; and another a carpet, on which, when he sat, he was
      carried wherever he wished to find himself. Another made him beautiful for
      ever; and another, brave; and another, lucky: but the last fairy of all, a
      cross old thing, crept up and said, &ldquo;My child, you shall be <i>too</i>
      clever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This fairy&rsquo;s gift would have pleased the queen, if she had believed in it,
      more than anything else, because she was so clever herself. But she took
      no notice at all; and the fairies went each to her own country, and none
      of them stayed there at the palace, where nobody believed in them, except
      the king, a little. But the queen tossed all their nice boots and caps,
      carpets, purses, swords, and all, away into a dark lumber-room; for, of
      course, she thought that they were <i>all nonsense</i>, and merely old
      rubbish out of books, or pantomime &ldquo;properties.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;<i>Prince Prigio and his family</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      WELL, the little prince grew up. I think I&rsquo;ve told you that his name was
      Prigio&mdash;did I not? Well, that <i>was</i> his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot think how clever he was. He argued with his nurse as soon as he
      could speak, which was very soon. He argued that he did not like to be
      washed, because the soap got into his eyes. However, when he was told all
      about the <i>pores of the skin</i>, and how they could not be healthy if
      he was not washed, he at once ceased to resist, for he was very
      reasonable. He argued with his father that he did not see why there should
      be kings who were rich, while beggars were poor; and why the king&mdash;who
      was a little greedy&mdash;should have poached eggs and plum-cake at
      afternoon tea, while many other persons went without dinner. The king was
      so surprised and hurt at these remarks that he boxed the prince&rsquo;s ears,
      saying, &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll teach you to be too clever, my lad.&rdquo; Then he remembered the
      awful curse of the oldest fairy, and was sorry for the rudeness of the
      queen. And when the prince, after having his ears boxed, said that &ldquo;force
      was no argument,&rdquo; the king went away in a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, I cannot tell you how the prince was hated by all! He would go
      down into the kitchen, and show the cook how to make soup. He would visit
      the poor people&rsquo;s cottage, and teach them how to make the beds, and how to
      make plum pudding out of turnip-tops, and venison cutlets out of rusty
      bacon. He showed the fencing-master how to fence, and the professional
      cricketer how to bowl, and instructed the rat-catcher in breeding
      terriers. He set sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and assured the
      Astronomer Royal that the sun does not go round the earth&mdash;which, for
      my part, I believe it does. The young ladies of the court disliked dancing
      with him, in spite of his good looks, because he was always asking, &ldquo;Have
      you read this?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Have you read that?&rdquo;&mdash;and when they said they
      hadn&rsquo;t, he sneered; and when they said they <i>had</i>, he found them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way; correcting
      the accent of his French teacher, and trying to get his German tutor not
      to eat peas with his knife. He also endeavoured to teach the
      queen-dowager, his grandmother, an art with which she had long been
      perfectly familiar! In fact, he knew everything better than anybody else;
      and the worst of it was that he <i>did</i>: and he never was in the wrong,
      and he always said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so?&rdquo; And, what was more, he <i>had!</i>

    <p>
      As time went on, Prince Prigio had two younger brothers, whom everybody
      liked: They were not a bit clever, but jolly. Prince Alphonso, the third
      son, was round, fat, good-humoured, and as brave as a lion. Prince Enrico,
      the second, was tall, thin, and a &ldquo;little sad, but <i>never</i> too
      clever.&rdquo; Both were in love with two of their own cousins (with the
      approval of their dear parents); and all the world said, &ldquo;What nice,
      unaffected princes they are!&rdquo; But Prigio nearly got the country into
      several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors. Now, as
      Pantouflia was a rich, lazy country, which hated fighting, this was very
      unpleasant, and did not make people love Prince Prigio any better.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;<i>About the Firedrake.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      OF all the people who did not like Prigio, his own dear papa, King
      Grognio, disliked him most. For the king knew he was not clever himself.
      When he was in the counting-house, counting out his money, and when he
      happened to say, &ldquo;Sixteen shillings and fourteen and twopence are three
      pounds, fifteen,&rdquo; it made him wild to hear Prigio whisper, &ldquo;One pound, ten
      and twopence,&rdquo;&mdash;which, of course, it <i>is</i>. And the king was
      afraid that Prigio would conspire, and get made king himself&mdash;which
      was the last thing Prigio really wanted. He much preferred to idle about,
      and know everything without seeming to take any trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the king thought and thought. How was he to get Prigio out of the
      way, and make Enrico or Alphonso his successor? He read in books about it;
      and all the books showed that, if a king sent his three sons to do
      anything, it was always the youngest who did it, and got the crown. And he
      wished he had the chance. Well, it arrived at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/p015.jpg" alt="Page 15 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      There was a very hot summer! It began to be hot in March.&rsquo; All the rivers
      were dried up. The grass did not grow. The corn did not grow. The
      thermometers exploded with heat. The barometers stood at Set Fair. The
      people were much distressed, and came and broke the palace win-dows&mdash;as
      they usually do when things go wrong in Pantouflia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king consulted the learned men about the Court, who told him that
      probably a FIREDRAKE was in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the Firedrake is a beast, or bird, about the bigness of an elephant.
      Its body is made of iron, and it is always red-hot. A more terrible and
      cruel beast cannot be imagined; for, if you go near it, you are at once
      broiled by the Firedrake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the king was not ill-pleased: &ldquo;for,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;of course my three
      sons must go after the brute, the eldest first; and, as usual, it will
      kill the first two, and be beaten by the youngest. It is a little hard on
      Enrico, poor boy; but <i>anything</i> to get rid of that Prigio!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the king went to Prigio, and said that his country was in danger, and
      that he was determined to leave the crown to whichever of them would bring
      him the horns (for it has horns) and tail of the Firedrake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an awkward brute to tackle,&rdquo; the king said, &ldquo;but you are the
      oldest, my lad; go where glory waits you! Put on your armour, and be off
      with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img src="images/p017.jpg" alt="Page 17 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      This the king said, hoping that either the Firedrake would roast Prince
      Prigio alive (which he could easily do, as I have said; for he is all over
      as hot as a red-hot poker), or that, if the prince succeeded, at least his
      country would be freed from the monster.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the prince, who was lying on the sofa doing sums in compound division,
      for fun, said in the politest way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to the education your majesty has given me, I have learned that
      the Firedrake, like the siren, the fairy, and so forth, is a fabulous
      animal which does not exist. But even granting, for the sake of argument,
      that there is a Firedrake, your majesty is well aware that there is no
      kind of use in sending <i>me</i>. It is always the eldest son who goes out
      first, and comes to grief on these occasions, and it is always the third
      son that succeeds. Send Alphonso&rdquo; (this was the youngest brother), &ldquo;and <i>he</i>
      will do the trick at once. At least, if he fails, it will be most unusual,
      and Enrico can try his luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went back to his arithmetic and his slate, and the king had to
      send for Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico. They both came in very warm;
      for they had been whipping tops, and the day was unusually hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;just you two younger ones look at Prigio! You
      see how hot it is, and how coolly he takes it, and the country suffering;
      and all on account of a Firedrake, you know, which has apparently built
      his nest not far off. Well, I have asked that lout of a brother of yours
      to kill it, and he says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he does not believe in Firedrakes,&rdquo; interrupted Prigio, &ldquo;The
      weather&rsquo;s warm enough without going out hunting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not believe in Firedrakes!&rdquo; cried Alphonso. &ldquo;I wonder what you <i>do</i>
      believe in! Just let me get at the creature!&rdquo; for he was as brave as a
      lion. &ldquo;Hi! Page, my chain-armour, helmet, lance, and buckler! <i>A
      Molinda! A Molinda!</i>&rdquo; which was his <i>war-cry</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page ran to get the armour; but it was<i> so uncommonly hot</i> that
      he dropped it, and put his fingers in his mouth, crying!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better put on flannels, Alphonso, for this kind of work,&rdquo; said
      Prigio. &ldquo;And if I were you, I&rsquo;d take a light garden-engine, full of water,
      to squirt at the enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy thought!&rdquo; said Alphonso. &ldquo;I will!&rdquo; And off he went, kissed his dear
      Molinda, bade her keep a lot of dances for him (there was to be a dance
      when he had killed the Firedrake), and then he rushed to the field!
    </p>
    <p>
      But he never came back any more!
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone wept bitterly&mdash;everyone but Prince Prigio; for he thought it
      was a practical joke, and said that Alphonso had taken the opportunity to
      start off on his travels and see the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some dreadful mistake, sir,&rdquo; said Prigio to the king. &ldquo;You know
      as well as I do that the youngest son has always succeeded, up to now. But
      I entertain great hopes of Enrico!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he grinned; for he fancied it was all <i>nonsense</i>, and that there
      were no Firedrakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enrico was present when Prigio was consoling the king in this unfeeling
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enrico, my boy,&rdquo; said his majesty, &ldquo;the task awaits you, and the honour.
      When <i>you</i> come back with the horns and tail of the Fire-drake, you
      shall be crown prince; and Prigio shall be made an usher at the Grammar
      School&mdash;it is all he is fit for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enrico was not quite so confident as Alphonso had been. He insisted on
      making his will; and he wrote a poem about the pleasures and advantages of
      dying young. This is part of it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The violet is a blossom sweet,
       That droops before the day is done&mdash;
     Slain by thine overpowering heat, O Sun!
       And I, like that sweet purple flower,
     May roast, or boil, or broil, or bake,
       If burned by thy terrific power, Firedrake!
</pre>
    <p>
      This poem comforted Enrico more or less, and he showed it to Prigio. But
      the prince only laughed, and said that the second line of the last verse
      was not very good; for violets do not &ldquo;roast, or boil, or broil, or bake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enrico tried to improve it, but could not. So he read it to his cousin,
      Lady Kathleena, just as it was; and she cried over it (though I don&rsquo;t
      think she understood it); and Enrico cried a little, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, next day he started, with a spear, a patent refrigerator, and a
      lot of the bottles people throw at fires to put them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But <i>he</i> never came back again!
    </p>
    <p>
      After shedding torrents of tears, the king summoned Prince Prigio to his
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dastard!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Poltroon! <i>Your</i> turn, which should have come
      first, has arrived at last. <i>You</i> must fetch me the horns and the
      tail of the Fired rake. Probably you will be grilled, thank goodness; but
      who will give me back Enrico and Alphonso?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, your majesty,&rdquo; said Prigio, &ldquo;you must permit me to correct your
      policy. Your only reason for dispatching your sons in pursuit of this
      dangerous but I believe <i>fabulous</i> animal, was to ascertain which of
      us would most worthily succeed to your throne, at the date&mdash;long may
      it be deferred!&mdash;of your lamented decease. Now, there can be no
      further question about the matter. I, unworthy as I am, represent the sole
      hope of the royal family. Therefore to send me after the Firedrake were*
      both dangerous and unnecessary. Dangerous, because, if he treats me as you
      say he did my brothers&mdash;my unhappy brothers,&mdash;the throne of
      Pantouflia will want an heir. But, if I do come back alive&mdash;why, I
      cannot be more the true heir than I am at present; now <i>can</i> I? Ask
      the Lord Chief Justice, if you don&rsquo;t believe <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Subjunctive mood!   He was a great grammarian!
</pre>
    <p>
      These arguments were so clearly and undeniably correct that the king,
      unable to answer them, withdrew into a solitary place where he could
      express himself with freedom, and give rein to his passions.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;<i>How Prince Prigio was deserted by Everybody</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      MEANWHILE, Prince Prigio had to suffer many unpleasant things. Though he
      was the crown prince (and though his arguments were unanswerable),
      everybody shunned him for a coward. The queen, who did not believe in
      Firedrakes, alone took his side. He was not only avoided by all, but he
      had most disagreeable scenes with his own cousins, Lady Molinda and Lady
      Kathleena. In the garden Lady Molinda met him walking alone, and did not
      bow to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Molly,&rdquo; said the prince, who liked her, &ldquo;how have I been so
      unfortunate as to offend you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name, sir, is Lady Molinda,&rdquo; she said, very proudly; &ldquo;and you have
      sent your own brother to his grave!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, excuse me,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;I am certain he has merely gone off on
      his travels. He&rsquo;ll come back when he&rsquo;s tired: there <i>are</i> no
      Firedrakes; a French writer says they are &lsquo;purement fabuleux, purely
      fabulous, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Alphonso has gone on his travels, and will come back when he is
      tired! And was he then&mdash;tired&mdash;of <i>me</i>?&rdquo; cried poor
      Molinda, bursting into tears, and forgetting her dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I beg your pardon, I never noticed; I&rsquo;m sure I am very sorry,&rdquo; cried
      the prince, who, never having been in love himself, never thought of other
      people. And he tried to take Molinda&rsquo;s hand, but she snatched it from him
      and ran away through the garden to the palace, leaving Prince Prigio to
      feel foolish, for once, and ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Lady Kathleena, she swept past him like a queen, without a word. So
      the prince, for all his cleverness, was not happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After several days had gone by, the king returned from the solitary place
      where he had been speaking his mind. He now felt calmer and better; and so
      at last he came back to the palace. But on seeing Prince Prigio, who was
      lolling in a hammock, translating Egyptian hieroglyphs into French poetry
      for his mother, the king broke out afresh, and made use of the most cruel
      and impolite expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, he gave orders that all the Court should pack up and move to a
      distant city; and that Prince Prigio should be left alone in the palace by
      himself. For he was quite unendurable, the king said, and he could not
      trust his own temper when he thought of him. And he grew so fierce, that
      even the queen was afraid of him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor queen cried a good deal; Prigio being her favourite son, on
      account of his acknowledged ability and talent. But the rest of the
      courtiers were delighted at leaving Prince Prigio behind. For his part,
      he, very good-naturedly, showed them the best and shortest road to
      Falkenstein, the city where they were going; and easily proved that
      neither the chief secretary for geography, nor the general of the army,
      knew anything about the matter&mdash;which, indeed, they did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ungrateful courtiers left Prigio with hoots and yells, for they
      disliked him so much that they forgot he would be king one day. He
      therefore reminded them of this little fact in future history, which made
      them feel uncomfortable enough, and then lay down in his hammock and went
      to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he wakened, the air was cold and the day was beginning to grow dark.
      Prince Prigio thought he would go down and dine at a tavern in the town,
      for no servants had been left with him. But what was his annoyance when he
      found that his boots, his sword, his cap, his cloak&mdash;all his clothes,
      in fact, except those he wore,&mdash;had been taken away by the courtiers,
      merely to spite him! His wardrobe had been ransacked, and everything that
      had not been carried off had been cut up, burned, and destroyed. Never was
      such a spectacle of wicked mischief. It was as if hay had been made of
      everything he possessed. What was worse, he had not a penny in his pocket
      to buy new things; and his father had stopped his allowance of fifty
      thousand pounds a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you imagine anything more cruel and <i>unjust</i> than this conduct?
      for it was not the prince&rsquo;s fault that he was so clever. The cruel fairy
      had made him so. But, even if the prince had been born clever (as may have
      happened to you), was he to be blamed for that? The other people were just
      as much in fault for being born so stupid; but the world, my dear
      children, can never be induced to remember this. If you are clever, you
      will find it best not to let people know it&mdash;if you want them to like
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, here was the prince in a pretty plight. Not a pound in his pocket,
      not a pair of boots to wear, not even a cap to cover his head from the
      rain; nothing but cold meat to eat, and never a servant to answer the
      bell.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;<i>What Prince Prigio found in the garret.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE prince walked from room to room of the palace; but, unless he wrapped
      himself up in a curtain, there was nothing for him to wear when he went
      out in the rain. At last he climbed up a turret-stair in the very oldest
      part of the castle, where he had never been before; and at the very top
      was a little round room, a kind of garret. The prince pushed in the door
      with some difficulty&mdash;not that it was locked, but the handle was
      rusty, and the wood had swollen with the damp. The room was very dark;
      only the last grey light of the rainy evening came through a slit of a
      window, one of those narrow windows that they used to fire arrows out of
      in old times.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the dusk the prince saw a heap of all sorts of things lying on the
      floor and on the table. There were two caps; he put one on&mdash;an old,
      grey, ugly cap it was, made of felt. There was a pair of boots; and he
      kicked off his slippers, and got into <i>them</i>. They were a good deal
      worn, but fitted as if they had been made for him. On the table was a
      purse with just three gold coins&mdash;old ones, too&mdash;in it; and
      this, as you may fancy, the prince was very well pleased to put in his
      pocket. A sword, with a sword-belt, he buckled about his waist; and the
      rest of the articles, a regular collection of odds and ends, he left just
      where they were lying. Then he ran downstairs, and walked out of the hall
      door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;<i>What Happened to Prince Prigio in Town</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      BY this time the prince was very hungry. The town was just three miles
      off; but he had such a royal appetite, that he did not like to waste it on
      bad cookery, and the people of the royal town were bad cooks. &ldquo;I wish I
      were in &lsquo;The Bear,&rsquo; at Gluck-stein,&rdquo; said he to himself; for he remembered
      that there was a very good cook there. But, then, the town was twenty-one
      leagues away&mdash;sixty-three long miles!
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the prince said this, and taken just three steps, than he
      found himself at the door of the &ldquo;Bear Inn&rdquo; at Gluckstein!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the most extraordinary dream,&rdquo; said he to himself; for he was far
      too clever, of course, to believe in seven-league boots. Yet he had a pair
      on at that very moment, and it was they which had carried him in three
      strides from the palace to Gluckstein!
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, that the prince, in looking about the palace for clothes,
      had found his way into that very old lumber-room where the magical gifts
      of the fairies had been thrown by his clever mother, who did not believe
      in them. But this, of course, the prince did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you should be told that seven-league boots only take those prodigious
      steps when you say you <i>want</i> to go a long distance. Otherwise they
      would be very inconvenient&mdash;when you only want to cross the room, for
      example. Perhaps this has not been explained to you by your governess?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the prince walked into &ldquo;The Bear,&rdquo; and it seemed odd to him that
      nobody took any notice of him. And yet his face was as well known as that
      of any man in Pantouflia; for everybody had seen it, at least in pictures.
      He was so puzzled by not being attended to as usual, that <i>he quite
      forgot to take off his cap</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0011" id="linkimage-0011">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width:40%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/p031.jpg" alt="Page 31 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      He sat down at a table, however, and shouted &ldquo;<i>Kellner!</i>&rdquo; at which
      all the waiters jumped, and looked round in every direction, but nobody
      came to him. At first he thought they were too busy, but presently another
      explanation occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;has threatened to execute anybody who
      speaks to me, or helps me in any way. Well, I don&rsquo;t mean to starve in the
      midst of plenty, anyhow; here goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince rose, and went to the table in the midst of the room, where a
      huge roast turkey had just been placed. He helped himself to half the
      breast, some sausages, chestnut stuffing, bread sauce, potatoes, and a
      bottle of red wine&mdash;Burgundy. He then went back to a table in a
      corner, where he dined very well, nobody taking any notice of him. When he
      had finished, he sat watching the other people dining, and smoking his
      cigarette. As he was sitting thus, a very tall man, an officer in the
      uniform of the Guards, came in, and, walking straight to the prince&rsquo;s
      table, said: &ldquo;Kellner, clean this table, and bring in the bill of fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, the officer sat down suddenly in the prince&rsquo;s lap, as if
      he did not see him at all. He was a heavy man, and the prince, enraged at
      the insult, pushed him away and jumped to his feet. As he did so, <i>his
      cap dropped off</i>. The officer fell on his knees at once, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, my prince, pardon! I never saw you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was more than the prince could be expected to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Count Frederick von Matterhorn,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you must be
      intoxicated. Sir! you have insulted your prince and your superior officer.
      Consider yourself under arrest! You shall be sent to a prison to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this, the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in the tavern.
      They all declared that they had not seen the prince, nor ever had an idea
      that he was doing them the honour of being in the neighbourhood of their
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more offended, and convinced that there was a conspiracy to annoy
      and insult him, the prince shouted for the landlord, called for his bill,
      threw down his three pieces of gold without asking for change, and went
      into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a disgraceful conspiracy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The king shall answer for
      this! I shall write to the newspapers at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not put in a better temper by the way in which people hustled him
      in the street. They ran against him exactly as if they did not see him,
      and then staggered back in the greatest surprise, looking in every
      direction for the person they had jostled. In one of these encounters, the
      prince pushed so hard against a poor old beggar woman that she fell down.
      As he was usually most kind and polite, he pulled off his cap to beg her
      pardon, when, behold, the beggar woman gave one dreadful scream, and
      fainted! A crowd was collecting, and the prince, forgetting that he had
      thrown down all his money in the tavern, pulled out his purse. Then he
      remembered what he had done, and expected to find it empty; but, lo, there
      were three pieces of gold in it! Overcome with surprise, he thrust the
      money into the woman&rsquo;s hand, and put on his cap again. In a moment the
      crowd, which had been staring at him, rushed away in every direction, with
      cries of terror, declaring that there was a magician in the town, and a
      fellow who could appear and disappear at pleasure!
    </p>

      <img src="images/p035.jpg" alt="Page 35 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      By this time, you or I, or anyone who was not so extremely clever as
      Prince Prigio, would have understood what was the matter. He had put on,
      without knowing it, not only the seven-league boots, but the cap of
      darkness, and had taken Fortunatus&rsquo;s purse, which could never be empty,
      however often you took all the money out. All those and many other
      delightful wares the fairies had given him at his christening, and the
      prince had found them in the dark garret. But the prince was so extremely
      wise, and learned, and scientific, that he did not believe in fairies, nor
      in fairy gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indigestion,&rdquo; he said to himself: &ldquo;those sausages were not of the
      best; and that Burgundy was extremely strong. Things are not as they
      appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, as he was arguing with himself, he was nearly run over by a splendid
      carriage and six, the driver of which never took the slightest notice of
      him. Annoyed at this, the prince leaped up behind, threw down the two
      footmen, who made no resistance, and so was carried to the door of a
      magnificent palace. He was determined to challenge the gentleman who was
      in the carriage; but, noticing that he had a very beautiful young lady
      with him, whom he had never seen before, he followed them into the house,
      not wishing to alarm the girl, and meaning to speak to the gentleman when
      he found him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great ball was going on; but, as usual, nobody took any notice of the
      prince. He walked among the guests, being careful not to jostle them, and
      listening to their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all about himself! Everyone had heard of his disgrace, and almost
      everyone cried &ldquo;Serve him right!&rdquo; They said that the airs he gave himself
      were quite unendurable&mdash;that nothing was more rude than to be always
      in the right&mdash;that cleverness might be carried far too far&mdash;that
      it was better even to be born stupid (&ldquo;Like the rest of you,&rdquo; thought the
      prince); and, in fact, nobody had a good word for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, one had! It was the pretty lady of the carriage. I never could tell
      you how pretty she was. She was tall, with cheeks like white roses
      blushing: she had dark hair, and very large dark-grey eyes, and her face
      was the kindest in the world! The prince first thought how nice and good
      she looked, even before he thought how pretty she looked. <i>She</i> stood
      up for Prince Prigio when her partner would speak ill of him. She had
      never seen the prince, for she was but newly come to Pantouflia; but she
      declared that it was his <i>misfortune</i>, not his fault, to be so
      clever. &ldquo;And, then, think how hard they made him work at school! Besides,&rdquo;
       said this kind young lady, &ldquo;I hear he is extremely handsome, and very
      brave; and he has a good heart, for he was kind, I have heard, to a poor
      boy, and did all his examination papers for him, so that the boy passed
      first in <i>everything</i>. And now he is Minister for Education, though
      he can&rsquo;t do a line of Greek prose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince blushed at this, for he knew his conduct had not been
      honourable. But he at once fell over head and ears in love with the young
      lady, a thing he had never done in his life before, because&mdash;he said&mdash;&ldquo;women
      were so stupid!&rdquo; You see he was so clever!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, at this very moment&mdash;when the prince, all of a sudden, was as
      deep in love as if he had been the stupidest officer in the room&mdash;an
      extraordinary thing happened! Something seemed to give a whirr! in his
      brain, and in one instant <i>he knew all about it!</i> He believed in
      fairies and fairy gifts, and understood that his cap was the cap of
      darkness, and his shoes the seven-league boots, and his purse the purse of
      Fortunatus! He had read about those things in historical books: but now he
      believed in them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;<i>The Prince Falls in Love</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      HE understood all this, and burst out laughing, which nearly frightened an
      old lady near him out of her wits. Ah! how he wished he was only in
      evening dress, that he might dance with the charming young lady. But there
      he was, dressed just as if he were going out to hunt, if anyone could have
      seen him. So, even if he took off his cap of darkness, and became visible,
      he was no figure for a ball. Once he would not have cared, but now he
      cared very much indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the prince was not clever for nothing. He thought for a moment, then
      went out of the room, and, in three steps of the seven-league boots, was
      at his empty, dark, cold palace again. He struck a light with a flint and
      steel, lit a torch, and ran upstairs to the garret. The flaring light of
      the torch fell on the pile of &ldquo;rubbish,&rdquo; as the queen would have called
      it, which he turned over with eager hands. Was there&mdash;yes, there <i>was</i>
      another cap! There it lay, a handsome green one with a red feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince pulled off the cap of darkness, put on the other, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I wish I were dressed in my best suit of white and gold, with the
      royal Pantouflia diamonds!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one moment there he was in white and gold, the greatest and most
      magnificent dandy in the whole world, and the handsomest man!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about my boots, I wonder,&rdquo; said the prince; for his seven-league
      boots were stout riding-boots, not good to dance in, whereas <i>now</i> he
      was in elegant shoes of silk and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw down the wishing cap, put on the other&mdash;the cap of darkness&mdash;and
      made three strides in the direction of Gluckstein. But he was only three
      steps nearer it than he had been, and the seven-league boots were standing
      beside him on the floor!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;no man can be in two different pairs of boots at
      one and the same time! That&rsquo;s mathematics!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then hunted about in the lumber-room again till he found a small,
      shabby, old Persian carpet, the size of a hearthrug. He went to his own
      room, took a portmanteau in his hand, sat down on the carpet, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were in Gluckstein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment there he found himself; for this was that famous carpet which
      Prince Hussein bought long ago, in the market at Bisnagar, and which the
      fairies had brought, with the other presents, to the christening of Prince
      Prigio.

    </div>
    <p>
      When he arrived at the house where the ball was going on, he put the
      magical carpet in the portmanteau, and left it in the cloakroom, receiving
      a numbered ticket in exchange. Then he marched in all his glory (and, of
      course, without the cap of darkness) into the room where they were
      dancing. Everybody made place for him, bowing down to the ground, and the
      loyal band struck up <i>The Prince&rsquo;s March</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven bless our Prince Prigio! What is there he doesn&rsquo;t know? Greek,
      Swiss, German (High and Low), And the names of the mountains in Mexico,
      Heaven bless the prince!
    </p>
    <p>
      He used to be very fond of this march, and the words&mdash;some people
      even said he had made them himself. But now, somehow, he didn&rsquo;t much like
      it. He went straight to the Duke of Stumpfelbahn, the Hereditary Master of
      the Ceremonies, and asked to be introduced to the beautiful young lady.
      She was the daughter of the new English Ambassador, and her name was Lady
      Rosalind. But she nearly fainted when she heard who it was that wished to
      dance with her, for she was not at all particularly clever; and the prince
      had such a bad character for snubbing girls, and asking them difficult
      questions. However, it was impossible to refuse, and so she danced with
      the prince, and he danced very well. Then they sat out in the
      conservatory, among the flowers, where nobody came near them; and then
      they danced again, and then the Prince took her down to supper. And all
      the time he never once said, &ldquo;Have you read <i>this?</i>&rdquo; or &ldquo;Have you
      read <i>that?</i>&rdquo; or, &ldquo;What! you never heard of Alexander the Great?&rdquo; or
      Julius Caesar, or Michael Angelo, or whoever it might be&mdash;horrid,
      difficult questions he used to ask. That was the way he <i>used</i> to go
      on: but now he only talked to the young lady about <i>herself</i>; and she
      quite left off being shy or frightened, and asked him all about his own
      country, and about the Firedrake shooting, and said how fond she was of
      hunting herself. And the prince said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if <i>you</i> wish it, you shall have the horns and tail of a
      Firedrake to hang up in your hall, to-morrow evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she asked if it was not very dangerous work, Firedrake hunting; and
      he said it was nothing, when you knew the trick of it: and he asked her if
      she would but give him a rose out of her bouquet; and, in short, he made
      himself so agreeable and <i>unaffected</i>, that she thought him very nice
      indeed.

    </div>
    <p>
      For, even a clever person can be nice when he likes&mdash;above all, when
      he is not thinking about himself. And now the prince was thinking of
      nothing in the world but the daughter of the English Ambassador, and how
      to please her-He got introduced to her father too, and quite won his
      heart; and, at last, he was invited to dine next day at the Embassy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Pantouflia, it is the custom that a ball must not end while one of the
      royal family goes on dancing. <i>This</i> ball lasted till the light came
      in, and the birds were singing out of doors, and all the mothers present
      were sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then nothing would satisfy the prince, but that they all should go home
      singing through the streets; in fact, there never had been so merry a
      dance in all Pantouflia. The prince had made a point of dancing with
      almost every girl there: and he had suddenly become the most beloved of
      the royal family. But everything must end at last; and the prince, putting
      on the cap of darkness and sitting on the famous carpet, flew back to his
      lonely castle.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;<i>The Prince is Puzzled</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      PRINCE PRIGIO did not go to bed. It was bright daylight, and he had
      promised to bring the horns and tail of a Firedrake as a present to a
      pretty lady. He had said it was easy to do this; but now, as he sat and
      thought over it, he did not feel so victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where is the Firedrake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reflected for a little, and then ran upstairs to the garret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>should</i> be here!&rdquo; he cried, tossing the fairies&rsquo; gifts about;
      &ldquo;and, by George, here it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, he had found the spyglass of carved ivory which Prince Ali, in the
      <i>Arabian Nights</i>, bought in the bazaar in Schiraz. Now, this glass
      was made so that, by looking through it, you could see anybody or anything
      you wished, however far away. Prigio&rsquo;s first idea was to look at his lady.
      &ldquo;But she does not expect to be looked at,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;and I <i>won&rsquo;t!</i>&rdquo;
       On the other hand, he determined to look at the Firedrake; for, of course,
      he had no delicacy about spying on <i>him</i>, the brute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince clapped the glass to his eye, stared out of window, and there,
      sure enough, he saw the Firedrake. He was floating about in a sea of
      molten lava, on the top of a volcano. There he was, swimming and diving
      for pleasure, tossing up the flaming waves, and blowing fountains of fire
      out of his nostrils, like a whale spouting!
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0017" id="linkimage-0017">

    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/p044.jpg" alt="Page 44 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      The prince did not like the looks of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my cap of darkness, and my shoes of swiftness, and my sword of
      sharpness, I never could get near that beast,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and if I <i>did</i>
      stalk him, I could not hurt him. Poor little Alphonso! poor Enrico! what
      plucky fellows they were! I fancied that there was no such thing as a
      Firedrake: he&rsquo;s not in the Natural History books; and I thought the boys
      were only making fun, and would be back soon, safe and sound. How horrid
      being too clever makes one! And now, what <i>am</i> I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was he to do, indeed? And what would you have done? Bring the horns
      and tail he must, or perish in the adventure. Otherwise, how could he meet
      his lady?&mdash;why, she would think him a mere braggart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince sat down, and thought and thought; and the day went on, and it
      was now high noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he jumped up and rushed into the library, a room where nobody ever
      went except himself and the queen. There he turned the books upside down,
      in his haste, till he found an old one, by a French gentleman, Monsieur
      Cyrano de Bergerac. It was an account of a voyage to the moon, in which
      there is a great deal of information about matters not generally known;
      for few travellers have been to the moon. In that book, Prince Prigio
      fancied he would find something he half remembered, and that would be of
      use to him. And he <i>did!</i> So you see that cleverness, and minding
      your book, have some advantages, after all. For here the prince learned
      that there is a very rare beast called a Remora, which is at least as cold
      as the Firedrake is hot!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;<i>if I can only make these two fight</i>, why the
      Remora may kill the Firedrake, or take the heat out of him, at least, so
      that I may have a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he seized the ivory glass, clapped it to his eye, and looked for the
      Remora. Just the tip of his nose, as white as snow and as smooth as ice,
      was sticking out of a chink in a frozen mountain, not far from the burning
      mountain of the Firedrake.

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; said the prince softly to himself; and he jumped like mad into
      the winged shoes of swiftness, stuck on the cap of darkness, girdled
      himself with the sword of sharpness, and put a good slice of bread, with
      some cold tongue, in a wallet, which he slung on his back. Never you
      fight, if you can help it, except with plenty of food to keep you going
      and in good heart. Then off he flew, and soon he reached the volcano of
      the Firedrake.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;<i>The Prince and the Firedrake</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was dreadfully hot, even high up in the air, where the prince hung
      invisible. Great burning stones were tossed up by the volcano, and nearly
      hit him several times. Moreover, the steam and smoke, and the flames which
      the Firedrake spouted like foam from his nostrils, would have daunted even
      the bravest man. The sides of the hill, too, were covered with the
      blackened ashes of his victims, whom he had roasted when they came out to
      kill him. The garden-engine of poor little Alphonso was lying in the
      valley, all broken and useless. But the Firedrake, as happy as a wild duck
      on a lonely lock, was rolling and diving in the liquid flame, all red-hot
      and full of frolic. &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; shouted the prince. The Firedrake rose to the
      surface, his horns as red as a red crescent-moon, only bigger, and lashing
      the fire with his hoofs and his blazing tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he said in a hoarse, angry voice. &ldquo;Just let me get at you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; answered the prince. It was the first time he had forgotten his
      grammar, but he was terribly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; grunted the beast. &ldquo;I wish I could see you&rdquo;; and,
      horrible to relate, he rose on a pair of wide, flaming wings, and came
      right at the prince, guided by the sound of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the prince had never heard that Fire-drakes could fly; indeed, he had
      never believed in them at all, till the night before. For a moment he was
      numb with terror; then he flew down like a stone to the very bottom of the
      hill and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; grunted the Firedrake, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? Why can&rsquo;t you give a
      civil answer to a civil question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go back to your hole and swear, on your honour as a Firedrake,
      to listen quietly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my sacred word of honour,&rdquo; said the beast, casually scorching an eagle
      that flew by into ashes. The cinders fell, jingling and crackling, round
      the prince in a little shower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Firedrake dived back, with an awful splash of flame, and the
      mountain roared round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince now flew high above him, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A message from the Remora. He says you are afraid to fight him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; grunted the Firedrake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sends you his glove,&rdquo; said Prince Prigio, &ldquo;as a challenge to mortal
      combat, till death do you part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he dropped his own glove into the fiery lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; yelled the Firedrake. &ldquo;Just let me get at him!&rdquo; and he
      scrambled out, all red-hot as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and tell him you&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; said the prince; and with two
      strides he was over the frozen mountain of the Remora.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.&mdash;<i>The Prince and the Remora</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      If he had been too warm before, the prince was too cold now. The hill of
      the Remora was one solid mass of frozen steel, and the cold rushed out of
      it like the breath of some icy beast, which indeed it <i>was</i>. All
      around were things like marble statues of men in armour: they were the
      dead bodies of the knights, horses and all, who had gone out of old to
      fight the Remora, and who had been frosted up by him. The prince felt his
      blood stand still, and he grew faint; but he took heart, for there was no
      time to waste. Yet he could nowhere see the Remora. &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; shouted the
      prince. Then, from a narrow chink at the bottom of the smooth, black hill,&mdash;a
      chink no deeper than that under a door, but a mile wide,&mdash;stole out a
      hideous head!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as fiat as the head of a skate-fish, it was deathly pale, and two
      chill-blue eyes, dead-coloured like stones, looked out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came a whisper, like the breath of the bitter east wind on a
      wintry day:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you, and how can I come to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; said the prince from the top of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the flat, white head set itself against the edge of the chink from
      which it had peeped, and slowly, like the movement of a sheet of ice, it
      slipped upwards and curled upwards, and up, and up! There seemed no end to
      it at all; and it moved horribly, without feet, holding on by its own
      frost to the slippery side of the frozen hill. Now all the lower part of
      the black hill was covered with the horrid white thing coiled about it in
      smooth, flat shiny coils; and still the head was higher than the rest; and
      still the icy cold came nearer and nearer, like Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince almost fainted: everything seemed to swim; and in one moment
      more he would have fallen stiff on the mountain-top, and the white head
      would have crawled over him, and the cold coils would have slipped over
      him and turned him to stone. And still the thing slipped up, from the
      chink under the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the prince made a great effort; he moved, and in two steps he was far
      away, down in the valley where it was not so very cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; he shouted, as soon as his tongue could move within his chattering
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a clear, hissing answer, like frozen words dropping round him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I come down. What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the white folds began to slide, like melting ice, from the black
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Prigio felt the air getting warmer behind him, and colder in front
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round, and there were the trees beginning to blacken in the
      heat, and the grass looking like a sea of fire along the plains; for the
      Firedrake was coming!
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince just took time to shout, &ldquo;The Firedrake is going to pay you a
      visit!&rdquo; and then he soared to the top of a neighbouring hill, and looked
      on at what followed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;<i>The Battle</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was an awful sight to behold! When the Remora heard the name of the
      Firedrake, his hated enemy, he slipped with wonderful speed from the cleft
      of the mountain into the valley. On and on and on he poured over rock and
      tree, as if a frozen river could slide downhill; on and on, till there
      were miles of him stretching along the valley&mdash;miles of the
      smooth-ribbed, icy creature, crawling and slipping forwards. The green
      trees dropped their leaves as he advanced; the birds fell down dead from
      the sky, slain by his frosty breath! But, fast as the Remora stole
      forward, the Firedrake came quicker yet, flying and clashing his fiery
      wings. At last they were within striking distance; and the Firedrake,
      stooping from the air, dashed with his burning horns and flaming feet slap
      into the body of the Remora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there rose a steam so dreadful, such a white yet fiery vapour of
      heat, that no one who had not the prince&rsquo;s magic glass could have seen
      what happened. With horrible grunts and roars the Firedrake tried to burn
      his way right through the flat body of the Remora, and to chase him to his
      cleft in the rock. But the Remora, hissing terribly, and visibly melting
      away in places, yet held his ground; and the prince could see his cold
      white folds climbing slowly up the hoofs of the Firedrake&mdash;up and up,
      till they reached his knees, and the great burning beast roared like a
      hundred bulls with the pain. Then up the Firedrake leaped, and hovering on
      his fiery wings, he lighted in the midst of the Remora&rsquo;s back, and dashed
      into it with his horns. But the flat, cruel head writhed backwards, and,
      slowly bending over on itself, the wounded Remora slid greedily to fasten
      again on the limbs of the Firedrake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the prince, safe on his hill, was lunching on the loaf and the
      cold tongue he had brought with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go it, Remora! Go it, Firedrake! you&rsquo;re gaining. Give it him, Remora!&rdquo; he
      shouted in the wildest excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody had ever seen such a battle; he had it all to himself, and he never
      enjoyed anything more. He hated the Remora so much, that he almost wished
      the Firedrake could beat it; for the Firedrake was the more natural beast
      of the pair. Still, he was alarmed when he saw that the vast flat body of
      the Remora was now slowly coiling backwards, backwards, into the cleft
      below the hill; while a thick wet mist showed how cruelly it had suffered.
      But the Firedrake, too, was in an unhappy way; for his legs were now cold
      and black, his horns were black also, though his body, especially near the
      heart, glowed still like red-hot iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go it, Remora!&rdquo; cried the prince: &ldquo;his legs are giving way; he&rsquo;s groggy
      on his pins! One more effort, and he won&rsquo;t be able to move!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by this advice, the white, slippery Remora streamed out of his
      cavern again, more and more of him uncoiling, as if the mountain were
      quite full of him. He had lost strength, no doubt: for the steam and mist
      went up from him in clouds, and the hissing of his angry voice grew
      fainter; but so did the roars of the Firedrake. Presently they sounded
      more like groans; and at last the Remora slipped up his legs above the
      knees, and fastened on his very heart of fire. Then the Firedrake stood
      groaning like a black bull, knee-deep in snow; and still the Remora
      climbed and climbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go it now, Firedrake!&rdquo; shouted the prince; for he knew that if the Remora
      won, it would be too cold for him to draw near the place, and cut off the
      Firedrake&rsquo;s head and tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go it, Drake! he&rsquo;s slackening!&rdquo; cried the prince again; and the brave
      Firedrake made one last furious effort, and rising on his wings, dropped
      just on the spine of his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wounded Remora curled back his head again on himself, and again
      crawled, steaming terribly, towards his enemy. But the struggle was too
      much for the gallant Remora. The flat, cruel head moved slower; the steam
      from his thousand wounds grew fiercer; and he gently breathed his last
      just as the Firedrake, too, fell over and lay exhausted. With one final
      roar, like the breath of a thousand furnaces, the Firedrake expired.

    <p>
      The prince, watching from the hill-top, could scarcely believe that these
      two <i>awful scourges of Nature</i>, which had so long devastated his
      country, were actually dead. But when he had looked on for half-an-hour,
      and only a river ran where the Remora had been, while the body of the
      Firedrake lay stark and cold, he hurried to the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing the sword of sharpness, he hacked off, at two blows, the iron head
      and the tail of the Firedrake. They were a weary weight to carry; but in a
      few strides of the shoes of swiftness he was at his castle, where he threw
      down his burden, and nearly fainted with excitement and fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the castle clock struck half-past seven; dinner was at eight, and the
      poor prince crawled on hands and knees to the garret. Here he put on the
      wishing-cap; wished for a pint of champagne, a hot bath, and his best
      black velvet and diamond suit. In a moment these were provided; he bathed,
      dressed, drank a glass of wine, packed up the head and tail of the
      Firedrake; sat down on the flying carpet, and knocked at the door of the
      English Ambassador as the clocks were striking eight&rsquo; in Gluckstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Punctuality is the politeness of princes</i>; and a prince <i>is</i>
      polite when he is in love!
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was received at the door by a stout porter and led into the
      hall, where <i>several</i> butlers met him, and he laid the mortal remains
      of the Firedrake under the cover of the flying carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was led upstairs, and he made his bow to the pretty lady, who, of
      course, made him a magnificent courtesy. She seemed prettier and kinder
      than ever. The prince was so happy, that he never noticed how something
      went wrong about the dinner. The ambassador looked about, and seemed to
      miss someone, and spoke in a low voice to one of the servants, who
      answered also in a low voice, and what he said seemed to displease the
      ambassador. But the prince was so busy in talking to his lady, and in
      eating his dinner too, that he never observed anything unusual. He had <i>never</i>
      been at such a pleasant dinner!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;<i>A Terrible Misfortune</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN the ladies left, and the prince and the other gentlemen were alone,
      the ambassador appeared more gloomy than ever. At last he took the prince
      into a corner, on pretence of showing him a rare statue. &ldquo;Does your royal
      highness not know,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you are in considerable danger?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Still?&rdquo; said the prince, thinking of the Firedrake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ambassador did not know what he meant, for <i>he</i> had never heard
      of the fight, but he answered gravely: &ldquo;Never more than now.&rdquo; Then he
      showed the prince two proclamations, which had been posted all about the
      town. Here is the first:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     TO  ALL  LOYAL  SUBJECTS.

     Whereas,

     Our eldest son, Prince Prigio, hath of late been guilty of
     several high crimes and misdemeanours.

     First: By abandoning the post of danger against the
     Firedrake, whereby our beloved sons, Prince Alphonso and
     Prince Enrico, have perished, and been overdone by that
     monster.

     Secondly: By attending an unseemly revel in the town of
     Gluckstein, where he brawled in the streets.

     Thirdly: By trying to seduce away the hearts of our loyal
     subjects in that city, and to blow up a party against our
     crown and our peace.

     [Illustration: Page 61]

     This is to give warning,

     That whoever consorts with, comforts, aids, or abets the
     said Prince Prigio, is thereby a partner in his treason; and
     That a reward of Five Thousand Purses will be given to
     whomsoever brings the said prince, alive, to our Castle of
     Falkenstein.

     Grognio R.
</pre>
    <p>
      And here is the second proclamation:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Reward. The firedrake. <i>Whereas</i>,

     Our dominions have lately been devastated by a Firedrake
     (the <i>Salamander Furiosus</i> of Buffon);

     <i>This is to advise all</i>,

     That whosoever brings the horns and tail of the said
     Firedrake to our Castle of Falkenstein, shall receive Five
     Thousand Purses, the position of Crown Prince, with the
     usual perquisites, and the hand of the king&rsquo;s niece, the
     Lady Molinda.

     Grognio R.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;I did not think his majesty wrote so well;&rdquo; and
      he would have <i>liked</i> to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we might join the
      ladies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said the ambassador, &ldquo;the streets are lined with soldiers; and
      I know not how you have escaped them. <i>Here</i>, under my roof, you are
      safe for the moment; but a prolonged stay&mdash;excuse my inhospitality&mdash;could
      not but strain the harmonious relations which prevail between the
      Government of Pantouflia and that which I have the honour to represent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to fight; and no more, I think, do you,&rdquo; said the prince,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how does your royal highness mean to treat the proclamations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, by winning these ten thousand purses. I can tell you £1,000,000 is
      worth having,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll deliver up the said prince, alive,
      at Falkenstein this very night; also the horns and tail of the said
      Firedrake. But I don&rsquo;t want to marry my Cousin Molly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I remind your royal highness that Falkenstein is three hundred miles
      away? Moreover, my head butler, Benson, disappeared from the house before
      dinner, and I fear he went to warn Captain Kopzoffski that you are <i>here!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;but, my dear Lord Kelso, may I not
      have the pleasure of presenting Lady Rosalind with a little gift, a
      Philippine which I lost to her last night, merely the head and tail of a
      Firedrake which I stalked this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ambassador was so astonished that he ran straight upstairs, forgetting
      his manners, and crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Linda! Linda! come down at once; here&rsquo;s a surprise for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Rosalind came sweeping down, with a smile on her kind face. <i>She</i>
      guessed what it was, though the prince had said nothing about it at
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lead the way, your royal highness!&rdquo; cried the ambassador; and the prince
      offering Lady Rosalind his arm, went out into the hall, where he saw
      neither his carpet nor the horns and tail of the Firedrake!
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned quite pale, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly ask the servants where the little Persian prayer-rug and
      the parcel which I brought with me have been placed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Kelso rang the bell, and in came all the servants, with William, the
      under-butler, at their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;where have you put his royal highness&rsquo;s
      parcel and his carpet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, your lordship,&rdquo; said William, &ldquo;we think Benson have took them
      away with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is Benson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, your lordship. We think he have been come for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come for&mdash;by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William stammered, and seemed at a loss for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! answer! what do you know about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William said at last, rather as if he were making a speech:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your royaliness, and my lords and ladies, it was like this. His
      royaliness comed in with a rug over his arm, and summat under it. And he
      lays it down on that there seat, and Thomas shows him into the
      droring-room. Then Benson says: &lsquo;Dinner&rsquo;ll be ready in five minutes; how
      tired I do feel! &lsquo;Then he takes the libbuty of sitting hisself down on his
      royaliness&rsquo;s rug, and he says, asking your pardon, &lsquo;I &lsquo;ve had about enough
      of service here. I &lsquo;m about tired, and I thinks of bettering myself. I
      wish I was at the king&rsquo;s court, and butler.&rsquo;
    </p>

      <img src="images/p065.jpg" alt="Page 65 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      But before the words was out of his mouth, off he flies like a shot
      through the open door, and his royaliness&rsquo;s parcel with him. I run to the
      door, and there he was, flying right hover the town, in a northerly
      direction. And that&rsquo;s all I know; for I would not tell a lie, not if it
      was hever so. And me, and Thomas&mdash;as didn&rsquo;t see it,&mdash;and cook,
      we thinks as how Benson was come for. And cook says as she don&rsquo;t wonder at
      it, neither; for a grumblinger, more ill-conditioneder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, William,&rdquo; said Lord Kelso; &ldquo;that will do; you can go, for the
      present.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;<i>Surprises</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE prince said nothing, the ambassador said nothing, Lady Rosalind said
      never a word till they were in the drawing-room. It was a lovely warm
      evening, and the French windows were wide open on the balcony, which
      looked over the town and away north to the hills. Below them flowed the
      clear, green water of the Gluckthal And still nobody said a word. At last
      the prince spoke: &ldquo;This is a very strange story, Lord Kelso!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, sir!&rdquo; said the ambassador. &ldquo;But true,&rdquo; added the prince; &ldquo;at least,
      there is no reason in the nature of things why it shouldn&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly believe, sir, that the conduct of Benson, whom I always
      found a most respectable man, deserved&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he should be &lsquo;come for,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Oh, no; it was a mere
      accident, and might have happened to any of us who chanced to sit down on
      my carpet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the prince told them, shortly, all about it: how the carpet was
      one of a number of fairy properties, which had been given him at his
      christening; and how so long a time had gone by before he discovered them;
      and how, probably, the carpet had carried the butler where he had said he
      wanted to go&mdash;namely, to the king&rsquo;s Court at Falkenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not matter so much,&rdquo; added the prince, &ldquo;only I had relied on
      making my peace with his majesty, my father, by aid of those horns and
      that tail. He was set on getting them; and if the Lady Rosalind had not
      expressed a wish for them, they would to-day have been in his possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, you honour us too highly,&rdquo; murmured Lady Rosalind; and the
      prince blushed and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all! Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, of course, the ambassador became quite certain that his daughter was
      admired by the crown prince, who was on bad terms with the king of the
      country; and a more uncomfortable position for an ambassador&mdash;however,
      they are used to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth am I to do with the young man?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t stay
      here for ever; and without his carpet he can&rsquo;t get away, for the soldiers
      have orders to seize him as soon as he appears in the street. And in the
      meantime Benson will be pretending that <i>he</i> killed the Firedrake&mdash;for
      he must have got to Falkenstein by now,&mdash;and they will be for
      marrying him to the king&rsquo;s niece, and making my butler crown prince to the
      kingdom of Pantouflia! It is dreadful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now all this time the prince was on the balcony, telling Lady Rosalind all
      about how he got the Firedrake done for, in the most modest way; for, as
      he said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill him: and it is really the Remora, poor fellow, who
      should marry Molly; but he &lsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this very moment there was a <i>whizz</i> in the air; something shot
      past them, and, through the open window, the king, the queen, Benson, and
      the mortal remains of the Firedrake were shot into the ambassador&rsquo;s
      drawing room!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;<i>The King Explains.</i>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE first who recovered his voice and presence of mind was Benson.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your lordship ring for coffee?&rdquo; he asked, quietly; and when he was
      told &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he bowed and withdrew, with majestic composure. When he had
      gone, the prince threw himself at the king&rsquo;s feet, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, pardon, my liege!&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me, sir!&rdquo; answered the king,
      very angrily; and the poor prince threw himself at the feet of the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she took no notice of him whatever, no more than if he had been a
      fairy; and the prince heard her murmur, as she pinched her royal arms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall waken presently; this is nothing out of the way for a dream. Dr.
      Rumpfino ascribes it to imperfect nutrition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time, the Lady Rosalind, as pale as a marble statue, was leaning
      against the side of the open window. The prince thought he could do
      nothing wiser than go and comfort her, so he induced her to sit down on a
      chair in the balcony,&mdash;for he felt that he was not wanted in the
      drawing-room;&mdash;and soon they were talking happily about the stars,
      which had begun to appear in the summer night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the ambassador had induced the king to take a seat; but there
      was no use in talking to the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a miracle,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;and miracles do not happen;
      therefore this has not happened. Presently, I shall wake up in my own bed
      at Falkenstein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, Benson, William, and Thomas brought in the coffee, but the queen took
      no notice. When they went away, the rest of the company slipped off
      quietly, and the king was left alone with the ambassador; for the queen
      could hardly be said to count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to know all about it, I suppose?&rdquo; said his majesty in a sulky
      voice. &ldquo;Well, you have a right to it, and I shall tell you. We were just
      sitting down to dinner at Falkenstein, rather late,&mdash;hours get later
      every year, I think&mdash;when I heard a row in the premises, and the
      captain of the guard, Colonel McDougal, came and told us that a man had
      arrived with the horns and tail of the Firedrake, and was claiming the
      reward. Her majesty and I rose and went into the outer court, where we
      found, sitting on that carpet with a glass of beer in his hand, a
      respectable-looking upper servant, whom I recognised as your butler. He
      informed us that he had just killed the beast, and showed us the horns and
      tail, sure enough; there they are! The tail is like the iron handle of a
      pump, but the horns are genuine. A pair were thrown up by a volcano, in my
      great-grandfather&rsquo;s time Giglio I.* Excellent coffee this, of yours!&rdquo;
     </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      The ambassador bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we asked him <i>where</i> he killed the Firedrake, and he said in a
      garden near Gluckstein. Then he began to speak about the reward, and the
      &lsquo;perkisits,&rsquo; as he called them, which it seems he had read about in my
      proclamation. Rather a neat thing; drew it up myself,&rdquo; added his majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much to the point,&rdquo; said the ambassador, wondering what the king was
      coming to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad you like it,&rdquo; said the king, much pleased. &ldquo;Well, where was I? Oh,
      yes; your man said he had killed the creature in a garden, quite near
      Gluckstein. I didn&rsquo;t much like the whole affair: he is an alien, you see;
      and then there was my niece, Molinda&mdash;poor girl, <i>she</i> was
      certain to give trouble. Her heart is buried, if I may say so, with poor
      Alphonso. But the queen is a very remarkable woman&mdash;very remarkable&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very!&rdquo; said the ambassador, with perfect truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Caitiff!&rsquo; she cries to your butler,&rdquo; his majesty went on; &ldquo;&lsquo;perjured
      knave, thou liest in thy throat! Gluckstein is a hundred leagues from
      here, and how say est thou that thou slewest the molester, and earnest
      hither in a few hours&rsquo; space?&rsquo; This had not occurred to me,&mdash;I am a
      plain king, but I at once saw the force of her majesty&rsquo;s argument. Yes,&rsquo;
      said I; &lsquo;how did you manage it?&rsquo; But he&mdash;your man, I mean&mdash;was
      not a bit put out. &lsquo;Why, your majesty,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I just sat down on that
      there bit of carpet, wished I was here, and here <i>I ham</i>. And I &lsquo;d be
      glad, having had the trouble,&mdash;and my time not being my own,&mdash;to
      see the colour of them perkisits, according to the proclamation.&rsquo; On this
      her majesty grew more indignant, if possible. &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;a
      story out of the &lsquo;Arabian Nights&rsquo; is not suited for a modern public, and
      fails to win æsthetic credence.&rsquo; These were her very words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her majesty&rsquo;s expressions are ever choice and appropriate,&rdquo; said the
      ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sit down there, on the carpet, knave,&rsquo; she went on; &lsquo;ourself and
      consort&rsquo;&mdash;meaning <i>me</i>&mdash;&lsquo;will take our places by thy side,
      and I shall wish us in Gluckstein, at thy master&rsquo;s! When the experiment
      has failed, thy head shall from thy shoulders be shorn!&rsquo; So your man
      merely said, &lsquo;Very well, mum,&mdash;your majesty, I mean,&rsquo; and sat down.
      The queen took her place at the edge of the carpet; I sat between her and
      the butler, and she said, &lsquo;I wish I were in Gluckstein!&rsquo; Then we rose,
      flew through the air at an astonishing pace, and here we are! So I suppose
      the rest of the butler&rsquo;s tale is true, which I regret; but a king&rsquo;s word
      is sacred, and he shall take the place of that sneak, Prigio. But as we
      left home before dinner, and <i>yours</i> is over, may I request your
      lordship to believe that I should be delighted to take something cold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ambassador at once ordered a sumptuous collation, to which the king
      did full justice; and his majesty was shown to the royal chamber, as he
      complained of fatigue. The queen accompanied him, remarking that she was
      sound asleep, but would waken presently. Neither of them said &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo;
       to the prince. Indeed, they did not see him again, for he was on the
      balcony with Lady Rosalind. They found a great deal to say to each other,
      and at last the prince asked her to be his wife; and she said that if the
      king and her father gave their permission&mdash;why, then she would! After
      this she went to bed; and the prince, who had not slept at all the night
      before, felt very sleepy also. But he knew that first he had something
      that must be done. So he went into the drawing-room, took his carpet, and
      wished to be&mdash;now where do you suppose? Beside the dead body of the
      Firedrake! There he was in a moment; and dreadful the body looked, lying
      stark and cold in the white moonshine. Then the prince cut off its four
      hoofs, put them in his wallet, and with these he flew back in a second,
      and met the ambassador just as he came from ushering the king to bed. Then
      the prince was shown his own room, where he locked up the hoofs, the
      carpet, the cap of darkness, and his other things in an iron box; and so
      he went to bed and dreamed of his Lady Rosalind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;<i>The King&rsquo;s Cheque</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN they all awakened next morning, their first ideas were confused. It
      is often confusing to wake in a strange bed, much more so when you have
      flown through the air, like the king, the queen, and Benson the butler.
      For her part, the queen was the most perplexed of all; for she did
      undeniably wake, and yet she was not at home, where she had expected to
      be. However, she was a determined woman, and stood to it that nothing
      unusual was occurring. The butler made up his mind to claim the crown
      princeship and the hand of the Lady Molinda; because, as he justly
      remarked to William, here was such a chance to better himself as might not
      soon come in his way again. As for the king, he was only anxious to get
      back to Falkenstein, and have the whole business settled in a
      constitutional manner. The ambassador was not sorry to get rid of the
      royal party; and it was proposed that they should all sit down on the
      flying carpet, and wish themselves at home again. But the queen would not
      hear of it: she said it was childish and impossible; so the carriage was
      got ready for her, and she started without saying a word of good-bye to
      anyone. The king, Benson, and the prince were not so particular, and they
      simply flew back to Falkenstein in the usual way, arriving there at 11.35&mdash;a
      week before her majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king at once held a Court; the horns and tail of the monster were
      exhibited amidst general interest, and Benson and the prince were invited
      to state their claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benson&rsquo;s evidence was taken first. He declined to say exactly where or how
      he killed the Firedrake. There might be more of them left, he remarked,&mdash;young
      ones, that would take a lot of killing,&mdash;and he refused to part with
      his secret. Only he claimed the reward, which was offered, if you
      remember, <i>not</i> to the man who killed the beast, but to him wha
      brought its horns and tail. This was allowed by the lawyers present to be
      very sound law; and Benson was cheered by the courtiers, who decidedly
      preferred him to Prigio, and who, besides, thought he was going to be
      crown prince. As for Lady Molinda, she was torn by the most painful
      feelings; for, much as she hated Prigio, she could not bear the idea of
      marrying Benson. Yet one or the other choice seemed certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappy lady! Perhaps no girl was ever more strangely beset by misfortune!
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Prigio was now called on to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He admitted that the reward was offered for bringing the horns and tail,
      not for killing the monster. But were the king&rsquo;s <i>intentions</i> to go
      for nothing? When a subject only <i>meant</i> well, of course he had to
      suffer; but when a king said one thing, was he not to be supposed to have
      meant another? Any fellow with a waggon could <i>bring</i> the horns and
      tail; the difficult thing was to kill the monster. If Benson&rsquo;s claim was
      allowed, the royal prerogative of saying one thing and meaning something
      else was in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this argument, the king so far forgot himself as to cry,
      &ldquo;Bravo, well said!&rdquo; and to clap his hands, whereon all the courtiers
      shouted and threw up their hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince then said that whoever had killed the monster could, of course,
      tell where to find him, and could bring his hoofs. He was ready to do this
      himself. Was Mr. Benson equally ready? On this being interpreted to him&mdash;for
      he did not speak Pantouflian&mdash;Benson grew pale with horror, but fell
      back on the proclamation. He had brought the horns and tail, and so he
      must have the perquisites, and the Lady Molinda!
    </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s mind was so much confused by this time, that he determined to
      leave it to the Lady Molinda herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of them will you have, my dear?&rdquo; he asked, in a kind voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But poor Molinda merely cried. Then his majesty was almost <i>driven</i>
      to say that he would give the reward to whoever produced the hoofs by that
      day week. But no sooner had he said this than the prince brought them out
      of his wallet, and displayed them in open Court. This ended the case; and
      Benson, after being entertained with sherry and sandwiches in the
      steward&rsquo;s room, was sent back to his master, And I regret to say that his
      temper was not at all improved by his failure to better himself. On the
      contrary, he was unusually cross and disagreeable for several days; but we
      must, perhaps, make some allowance for his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Benson was irritated, and suffered from the remarks of his
      fellow-servants, I do not think we can envy Prince Prigio. Here he was,
      restored to his position indeed, but by no means to <i>the royal favour</i>.
      For the king disliked him as much as ever, and was as angry as ever about
      the deaths of Enrico and Alphonso. Nay, he was even <i>more</i> angry;
      and, perhaps, not without reason. He called up Prigio before the whole
      Court, and thereon the courtiers cheered like anything, but the king
      cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! McDougal, drag the first man that shouts to the serpent-house in
      the zoological gardens, and lock him up with the rattlesnakes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that the courtiers were very quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said the king, as Prigio bowed before the throne, &ldquo;you are
      restored to your position, because I cannot break my promise. But your
      base and malevolent nature is even more conspicuously manifest in your
      selfish success than in your previous dastardly contempt of duty. Why,
      confound you!&rdquo; cried the king, dropping the high style in which he had
      been speaking, and becoming the <i>father</i>, not the monarch,&mdash;&ldquo;why,
      if you <i>could</i> kill the Firedrake, did you let your poor little
      brothers go and be b&mdash;b&mdash;b&mdash;broiled? Eh! what do you say,
      you sneak? &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t believe there <i>were</i> any Firedrakes?&rsquo; That
      just comes of your eternal conceit and arrogance! If you were clever
      enough to kill the creature&mdash;and I admit that&mdash;you were clever
      enough to know that what everybody said must be true. &lsquo;You have not
      generally found it so?&rsquo; Well, you <i>have</i> this time, and let it be a
      lesson to you; not that there is much comfort in that, for it is not
      likely you will ever have such another chance&rdquo;&mdash;exactly the idea that
      had occurred to Benson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the king wept, among the tears of the lord chief justice, the poet
      laureate (who had been awfully frightened when he heard of the
      rattlesnakes), the maids of honour, the chaplain royal, and everyone but
      Colonel McDougal, a Scottish soldier of fortune, who maintained a military
      reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his majesty had recovered, he said to Prigio (who had not been
      crying, he was too much absorbed):
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A king&rsquo;s word is his bond. Bring me a pen, somebody, and my cheque-book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The royal cheque-book, bound in red morocco, was brought in by eight
      pages, with ink and a pen. His majesty then filled up and signed the
      following satisfactory document&mdash;(Ah! my children, how I wish Mr.
      Arrowsmith would do as much for <i>me</i>!):
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said his majesty, crossing his cheque and throwing sand over it,
      for blotting-paper had not yet been invented; &ldquo;there, take <i>that</i>,
      and be off with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Prigio was respectfully but rapidly obeying his royal command, for
      he thought he had better cash the royal cheque as soon as possible, when
      his majesty yelled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi! here! come back! I forgot something; you&rsquo;ve got to marry Molinda!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;<i>A Melancholy Chapter</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE prince had gone some way, when the king called after him. How he
      wished he had the seven-league boots on, or that he had the cap of
      darkness in his pocket! If he had been so lucky, he would now have got
      back to Gluckstein, and crossed the border with Lady Rosalind. A million
      of money may not seem much, but a pair of young people who really love
      each other could live happily on less than the cheque he had in his
      pocket. However, the king shouted very loud, as he always did when he
      meant to be obeyed, and the prince sauntered slowly back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prigio!&rdquo; said his majesty, &ldquo;where were you off to? Don&rsquo;t you remember
      that this is your wedding-day? My proclamation offered, not only the money
      (which you have), but the hand of the Lady Molinda, which the Court
      chaplain will presently make your own. I congratulate you, sir; Molinda is
      a dear girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the highest affection and esteem for my cousin, sir,&rdquo; said the
      prince, &ldquo;but:&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never marry him!&rdquo; cried poor Molinda, kneeling at the throne, where
      her streaming eyes and hair made a pretty and touching picture. &ldquo;Never! I
      despise him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0032" id="linkimage-0032">

    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img src="images/p084.jpg" alt="Page 84 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to say, sir,&rdquo; the prince went on, &ldquo;that I cannot possibly
      have the pleasure of wedding my cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The family gibbet, I presume, is in good working order?&rdquo; asked the king
      of the family executioner, a tall gaunt man in black and scarlet, who was
      only employed in the case of members of the blood royal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never better, sire,&rdquo; said the man, bowing with more courtliness than his
      profession indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;Prince Prigio, you have your choice. <i>There</i>
      is the gallows, <i>here</i> is Lady Molinda. My duty is painful, but
      clear. A king&rsquo;s word cannot be broken. Molly, or the gibbet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince bowed respectfully to Lady Molinda:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, my cousin,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your clemency will excuse my answer, and you
      will not misinterpret the apparent discourtesy of my conduct. I am
      compelled, most unwillingly, to slight your charms, and to select the
      Extreme Rigour of the Law. Executioner, lead on! Do your duty; for me, <i>Prigio
      est prêt</i>;&rdquo;&mdash;for this was his motto, and meant that he was ready.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/p085.jpg" alt="Page 85 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      Poor Lady Molinda could not but be hurt by the prince&rsquo;s preference for
      death over marriage to her, little as she liked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is life, then, so worthless? and is Molinda so terrible a person that you
      prefer <i>those</i> arms,&rdquo; and she pointed to the gibbet, &ldquo;to <i>these?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;here
      she held out her own, which were very white, round and pretty; for Molinda
      was a good-hearted girl, she could not bear to see Prigio put to death;
      and then, perhaps, she reflected that there are worse positions than the
      queenship of Pantouflia. For Alphonso was gone&mdash;crying would not
      bring him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Madam!&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;you are forgiving&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For <i>you</i> are brave!&rdquo; said Molinda, feeling: quite a respect for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But neither your heart nor mine is ours to give. Since mine was
      another&rsquo;s, I understand too well the feeling of <i>yours!</i> Do not let
      us buy life at the price of happiness and honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to the king the prince said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, is there no way but by death or marriage? You say you cannot keep
      half only of your promise; and that, if I accept the reward, I must also
      unite myself with my unwilling cousin. Cannot the whole proclamation be
      annulled, and will you consider the bargain void if I tear up this flimsy
      scroll?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here the prince fluttered the cheque for £1,000,000 in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the king was tempted; but then he said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, it&rsquo;s only an extra penny on the income-tax.&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;Keep your
      dross,&rdquo; he shouted, meaning the million; &ldquo;but let <i>me</i> keep my
      promise. To chapel at once, or&mdash;&rdquo; and he pointed to the executioner.
      &ldquo;The word of a king of Pantouflia is sacred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so is that of a crown prince,&rdquo; answered Prigio; &ldquo;and <i>mine</i> is
      pledged to a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall be a mourning bride,&rdquo; cried the king savagely, &ldquo;unless&rdquo;&mdash;here
      he paused for a moment&mdash;&ldquo;unless you bring me back Alphohso and
      Enrico, safe and well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince thought for the space of a flash of lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the alternative,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if your majesty will grant me my
      conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name them!&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me be transported to Gluckstein, left there unguarded, and if, in
      three days, I do not return with my brothers safe and well, your majesty
      shall be spared a cruel duty. Prigio of Pantouflia will perish by his own
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king, whose mind did not work very quickly, took some minutes to think
      over it. Then he saw that by granting the prince&rsquo;s conditions, he would
      either recover his dear sons, or, at least, get rid of Prigio, without the
      unpleasantness of having him executed. For, though some kings have put
      their eldest sons to death, and most have wished to do so, they have never
      been better loved by the people for their Roman virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour bright?&rdquo; said the king at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour bright!&rdquo; answered the prince, and for the first time in many
      months, the royal father and son shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you, madam,&rdquo; said Prigio in a stately way to Lady Molinda, &ldquo;in less
      than a week I trust we shall be taking our vows at the same altar, and
      that the close of the ceremony which finds us cousins will leave us
      brother and sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Molinda merely stared; for she could not imagine what he meant. In a
      moment he was gone; and having taken, by the king&rsquo;s permission, the flying
      carpet, he was back at the ambassador&rsquo;s house in Gluckstein.

      CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;<i>The Black Cat and the brethren</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHO was glad to see the prince, if it was not Lady Rosalind? The white
      roses of her cheeks turned to red roses in a moment, and then back to
      white again, they were so alarmed at the change. So the two went into the
      gardens together, and talked about a number of things; but at last the
      prince told her that, before three days were over, all would be well, or
      all would be over with him. For either he would have brought his brothers
      back, sound and well, to Falkenstein, or he would not survive his
      dishonour.

      &ldquo;It is no more than right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for had I gone first, neither of
      them would have been sent to meet the monster after I had fallen. And I <i>should</i>
      have fallen, dear Rosalind, if I had faced the Firedrake before I knew <i>you.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then when she asked him why, and what good she had done him, he told her
      all the story; and how, before he fell in love with her, he didn&rsquo;t believe
      in fairies, or Firedrakes, or caps of darkness, or anything nice and
      impossible, but only in horrid useless facts, and chemistry, and geology,
      and arithmetic, and mathematics, and even political economy. And the
      Firedrake would have made a mouthful of him, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was delighted when she heard this, almost as much delighted as she
      was afraid that he might fail in the most difficult adventure. For it was
      one thing to egg on a Remora to kill a Firedrake, and quite another to
      find the princes if they were alive, and restore them if they were dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the prince said he had his plan, and he stayed that night at the
      ambassador&rsquo;s. Next morning he rose very early, before anyone else was up,
      that he might not have to say &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; to Lady Rosalind. Then he flew in
      a moment to the old lonely castle, where nobody went for fear of ghosts,
      ever since the Court retired to Falkenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      How still it was, how deserted; not a sign of life, and yet the prince was
      looking everywhere <i>for some living thing</i>. He hunted the castle
      through in vain, and then went out to the stable-yard; but all the dogs,
      of course, had been taken away, and the farmers had offered homes to the
      poultry. At last, stretched at full length in a sunny place, the prince
      found a very old, half-blind, miserable cat. The poor creature was lean,
      and its fur had fallen off in patches; it could no longer catch birds, nor
      even mice, and there was nobody to give it milk. But cats do not look far
      into the future; and this old black cat&mdash;Frank was his name&mdash;had
      got a breakfast somehow, and was happy in the sun. The prince stood and
      looked at him pityingly, and he thought that even a sick old cat was, in
      some ways, happier than most men.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the prince at last, &ldquo;he could not live long anyway, and it
      must be done. He will feel nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he drew the sword of sharpness, and with one turn of his wrist cut
      the cat&rsquo;s head clean off.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not at once change into a beautiful young lady, as perhaps you
      expect; no, that was improbable, and, as the prince was in love already,
      would have been vastly inconvenient. The dead cat lay there, like any
      common cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the prince built up a heap of straw, with wood on it; and there he
      laid poor puss, and set fire to the pile. Very soon there was nothing of
      old black Frank left but ashes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the prince ran upstairs to the fairy cupboard, his heart beating
      loudly with excitement, The sun was shining through the arrow-shot window;
      all the yellow motes were dancing in its rays. The light fell on the
      strange heaps of fairy things&mdash;talismans and spells. The prince
      hunted about here and there, and at last he discovered six ancient
      water-vessels of black leather, each with a silver plate on it, and on the
      plate letters engraved. This was what was written on the plates:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>AQVA. DE. FONTE. LEONVM.</i>*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Water from the Fountain of Lions.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I thought they were sure to have brought
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he took one of the old black-leather bottles, and ran downstairs
      again to the place where he had burned the body of the poor old sick cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0036" id="linkimage-0036">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width:16%;">
      <img width="100%" src="images/p093.jpg" alt="Page 93 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      He opened the bottle, and poured a few drops of the water on the ashes and
      the dying embers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up there sprang a tall, white flame of fire, waving like a tongue of
      light; and forth from the heap jumped the most beautiful, strong, funny,
      black cat that ever was seen!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Frank as he had been in the vigour of his youth; and he knew the
      prince at once, and rubbed himself against him and purred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince lifted up Frank and kissed his nose for joy; and a bright tear
      rolled down on Frank&rsquo;s face, and made him rub his nose with his paw in the
      most comical manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the prince set him down, and he ran round and round after his tail;
      and, lastly, cocked his tail up, and marched proudly after the prince into
      the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Frank!&rdquo; said Prince Prigio, &ldquo;no cat since the time of Puss in Boots
      was ever so well taken care of as you shall be. For if the fairy water
      from the Fountain of Lions can bring <i>you</i> back to life&mdash;why,
      there is a chance for Alphonso and Enrico!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Prigio bustled about, got ready some cold luncheon from the
      store-room, took all his fairy things that he was likely to need, sat down
      with them on the flying carpet, and wished himself at the mountain of the
      Firedrake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the king now,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for if I can&rsquo;t find the ashes of my
      brothers, by Jove! I&rsquo;ll!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Do you know what he meant to do, if he could not find his brothers? Let
      every child-guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off he flew; and there he was in a second, just beside poor Alphonso&rsquo;s
      garden-engine. Then Prigio, seeing a little heap of grey ashes beside the
      engine, watered them with the fairy water; and up jumped Alphonso, as
      jolly as ever, his sword in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Prigio!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;are you come after the monster too? I&rsquo;ve been
      asleep, and I had a kind of dream that he beat me. But the pair of us will
      tackle him. How is Molinda?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prettier than ever,&rdquo; said Prigio; &ldquo;but anxious about you. However, the
      Firedrake&rsquo;s dead and done for; so never mind him. But I left Enrico
      somewhere about. Just you sit down and wait a minute, till I fetch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince said this, because he did not wish Alphonso to know that he and
      Enrico had not had quite the best of it in the affair with the monster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old fellow,&rdquo; says Alphonso; &ldquo;but have you any luncheon with
      you? Never was so hungry in my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Prigio had thought of this, and he brought out some cold sausage
      (to which Alphonso was partial) and some bread, with which the younger
      prince expressed himself satisfied. Then Prigio went up the hill some way,
      first warning Alphonso <i>not</i> to sit on his carpet for fear of <i>accidents</i>
      like that which happened to Benson. In a hollow of the hill, sure enough
      there was the sword of Enrico, the diamonds of the hilt gleaming in the
      sun. And there was a little heap of grey ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince poured a few drops of the water from the Fountain of Lions on
      them, and up, of course, jumped Enrico, just as Alphonso had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleepy old chap you are, Enrico,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;but come on, Alphonso
      will have finished the grub unless we look smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So back they came, in time to get their share of what was going; and they
      drank the Remora&rsquo;s very good health, when Prigio told them about the
      fight. But neither of them ever knew that they had been dead and done for;
      because Prigio invented a story that the mountain was enchanted, and that,
      as long as the Firedrake lived, everyone who came there fell asleep. He
      did tell them about the flying carpet, however, which of course did not
      much surprise them, because they had read all about it in the <i>Arabian
      Nights</i> and other historical works.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I &lsquo;ll show you fun!&rdquo; said Prigio; and he asked them both to take
      their seats on the carpet, and wished to be in the valley of the Remora.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they were in a moment, among the old knights whom, if you remember,
      the Remora had frozen into stone. There was quite a troop of them, in all
      sorts of armour&mdash;Greek and Roman, and Knight Templars like Front&rsquo; de
      Bouf and Brian du Bois Gilbert&mdash;all the brave warriors that had tried
      to fight the Remora since the world began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Prigio gave each of his brothers some of the water in their caps, and
      told them to go round pouring a drop or two on each frozen knight. And as
      they did it, lo and behold! each knight came alive, with his horse, and
      lifted his sword and shoute:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live Prince Prigio!&rdquo; in Greek, Latin, Egyptian, French, German, and
      Spanish,&mdash;all of which the prince perfectly understood, and spoke
      like a native.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he marshalled them in order, and sent them off to ride to Falkenstein
      and cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Prigio is coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Off they went, the horses&rsquo; hoofs clattering, banners flying, sunshine
      glittering on the spear-points. Off they rode to Falkenstein; and when the
      king saw them come galloping in, I can tell you he had no more notion of
      hanging Prigio.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;<i>The Very Last</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE princes returned to Gluckstein on the carpet, and went to the best
      inn, where they dined together and slept. Next morning they, and the
      ambassador, who had been told all the story, and Lady Rosalind, floated
      comfortably on the carpet, back to Falkenstein, where the king wept like
      anything on the shoulders of Alphonso and Enrico. They could not make out
      why he cried so, nor why Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena cried; but soon
      they were all laughing and happy again. But then&mdash;would you believe
      he could be so mean?&mdash;he refused to keep his royal promise, and
      restore Prigio to his crown-princeship! Kings are like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Prigio, very quietly asking for the head of the Firedrake, said he&rsquo;d
      pour the magic water on <i>that</i>, and bring the Firedrake back to life
      again, unless his majesty behaved rightly. This threat properly frightened
      King Grognio, and he apologised. Then the king shook hands with Prigio in
      public, and thanked him, and said he was proud of him. As to Lady
      Rosalind, the old gentleman quite fell in love with her, and he sent at
      once to the Chaplain Royal to get into his surplice, and marry all the
      young people off at once, without waiting for wedding-cakes, and
      milliners, and all the rest of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0039" id="linkimage-0039">

      <img width="100%" src="images/p100.jpg" alt="Page 100 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      Now, just as they were forming a procession to march into church, who
      should appear but the queen! Her majesty had been travelling by post all
      the time, and, luckily, had heard of none of the doings since Prigio,
      Benson, and the king left Gluckstein. I say <i>luckily</i> because if she
      had heard of them, she would not have believed a word of them. But when
      she saw Alphonso and Enrico, she was much pleased, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naughty boys! Where have you been hiding? The king had some absurd story
      about your having been killed by a fabulous monster. Bah! don&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i>.
      I always said you would come back after a little trip&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I,
      Prigio?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, madam,&rdquo; said Prigio; &ldquo;and I said so, too. Didn&rsquo;t I say so?&rdquo;
       And all the courtiers cried: &ldquo;Yes, you did;&rdquo; but some added, to
      themselves, &ldquo;He <i>always</i> says, &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say so?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the queen was introduced to Lady Rosalind, and she said it was
      &ldquo;rather a short engagement, but she supposed young people understood their
      own affairs best.&rdquo; And they do! So the three pairs were married, with the
      utmost rejoicings; and her majesty never, her whole life long, could be
      got to believe that anything unusual had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honeymoon of Prince Prigio and the Crown Princess Rosalind was passed
      at the castle, where the prince had been deserted by the Court. But now it
      was delightfully fitted up; and Master Frank marched about the house with
      his tail in the air, as if the place belonged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on the second day of their honeymoon, the prince and princess were
      sitting in the garden together, and the prince said, &ldquo;Are you <i>quite</i>
      happy, my dear?&rdquo; and Rosalind said, &ldquo;Yes; <i>quite</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the prince did not like the tone of her voice, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s something; do tell me what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rosalind, putting her head on his shoulder, and speaking very
      low, &ldquo;I want everybody to love you as much as I do. No, not quite so very
      much,&mdash;but I want them to like you. Now they <i>can&rsquo;t</i>, because
      they are afraid of you; for you are so awfully clever. Now, couldn&rsquo;t you
      take the wishing cap, and wish to be no cleverer than other people? Then
      everybody would like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince thought a minute, then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your will is law, my dear; anything to please you. Just wait a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he ran upstairs, for the last time, to the fairy garret, and he put
      on the wishing cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; thought he to himself, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t wish <i>that</i>. Every man has one
      secret from his wife, and this shall be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he said aloud: &ldquo;I wish to SEEM no CLEVERER THAN OTHER PEOPLE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he ran downstairs again, and the princess noticed a great difference
      in him (though, of course, there was really none at all), and so did
      everyone. For the prince remained as clever as ever he had been; but, as
      nobody observed it, he became the most popular prince, and finally the
      best-beloved king who had ever sat on the throne of Pantouflia.
    </p>
    <p>
      But occasionally Rosalind would say, &ldquo;I do believe, my dear, that you are
      really as clever as ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he <i>was!</i>
